# Support

We appreciate your engagement with our project and are committed to providing you with the support you may require. To ensure you receive the most effective and timely assistance, we have established a set of guidelines to help streamline the support process. 

## Read the README

**Make sure you have read and followed the `README`**. Every port will have this
file, explaining how to install the theme or modify the application to install
Catppuccin. It is shown by default when you visit a GitHub repository.

## Reporting Issues

If you've found a bug or have a feature request:

1. **Search existing issues**: Check if someone has already reported it
2. **Create a new issue**: Use our issue templates and provide:
   - Clear description of the problem or feature
   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
   - Expected vs actual behavior

## Community Support

[**Join our Discord server!**](https://discord.gg/ZmKUnugG6s) If you feel like your issue has gone stale or you
don't feel comfortable raising a GitHub Issue, feel free to join our Discord
server! The ADB.js community is active on Discord and you can post your
questions in our dedicated `#support` channel.

You can also ask for help and guidance on creating new ports to be transferred
into the ADB.js GitHub organisation.
